## 📚 About The Project

I wanted to get a deeper understanding of some more advanced features, so I decided to build this little project using what I've been learning so far, such as unitary tests with jest, dependency injection, and a better architecture to stop using only MVC.

I know I have a lot to improve, but this it's just a taste of what things I've improved until now.

In this project, I decided to use typeorm, which I find fantastic, because of its simple way to configure, and also because it has a lot of power when combined with typescript.

And to give the code a pattern, I used the VsCode prettier extension.
